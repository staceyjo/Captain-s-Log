If you finish lab early consider:
- adding some CSS and practice styling your app
- try working with the date object! Try to make it look human readable in HTML.

SUPER BONUS:
 - Add a second model for comments:
 - it should have the name of the person who wrote it
 - and some text for the comment (maybe time stamps?). 
 - This model should 'belong' the the post, 
 - the data should be related in some way. 
 - Do your own research on how to set up a one-to-many relationship 
 - (one post can have many comments, one comment only belongs to one post), 
 - in MongoDB. Use Mongo Documents, Google.
